# DISCLAIMER
This is a project I started working on on the initiative of my CS professor. I was still a rookie programmer at the time, I have learned so much since then. I reviewed this code again with a grin on my face, there's all kinds of stuff in there... Since this is one of my very first "major" projects, I think it's best not to touch it and preserve it. After all, this repo made it into the Arctic Code Vault, that's another reason why would it be a shame to update it. One day I may look at it again when I am even more experienced and make fun of younger self even more, who knows!
